## Day 3 Introduction to Text Mining in Python

This interactive course covers the basics of text mining using Python. Unstructured text (e.g. news) contains a vast amount of information but can be overwhelming to process. Text mining techniques can facilitate your navigation, organization, and insights discovery with unstructured text data. After the course, you should understand basic text manipulation in Python, standard pre-processing methods for English text, common transformations of unstructured text to quantitative data, and intuitive statistics to help navigate through a corpus.

### Mandatory pre-assignment:

1. Software setup:
  In this course we'll be using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to manage dependencies and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to run code. Please follow [these instructions](setup/software_setup.md) to ensure you have the correct setup.

2. If you haven't used Python at all previously, I recommend starting with the tutorials on [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) until the regular expression lesson then moving on to [DataCamp's free Introduction to Python course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) for more practice.

## Day 3 Introduction to Text Mining in Python

This interactive course covers the basics of text mining using Python. Unstructured text (e.g. news) contains a vast amount of information but can be overwhelming to process. Text mining techniques can facilitate your navigation, organization, and insights discovery with unstructured text data. After the course, you should understand basic text manipulation in Python, standard pre-processing methods for English text, common transformations of unstructured text to quantitative data, and intuitive statistics to help navigate through a corpus.

### Mandatory pre-assignment:

In this course we'll be using Anaconda to manage dependencies and Jupyter Notebooks to run code.

1. Get [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) that will help us manage packages with different Python versions and install different packages.
  - For those comfortable with the command line, feel free to download [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) instead.

2. Download a few packages (open source / free version) [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/install.html), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#installing-with-anaconda). 
  - 

3. If you haven't used Python at all previously, I recommend starting with the tutorials on [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) then moving on to [DataCamp's free Introduction to Python course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).

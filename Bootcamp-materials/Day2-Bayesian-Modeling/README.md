## Winter 2019-2020 Data Science Bootcamp
### Day 2 Bayesian Modeling with Stan

- When: Thursday, January 16th, 2020
- Where: Room 903 [SSW](http://stat.columbia.edu/location-and-directions/)
- **Topics**: This bootcamp will introduce participants to Bayesian inference using statistical software (called Stan) that has been developed primarily at Columbia University. No previous experience with Stan is necessary. In the morning, we will work through several concrete, but simple, examples of Bayesian thinking. In the afternoon, we will use Stan via a couple of R packages to perform Bayesian inference for the parameters of regression models and the implied predictions of the outcome. For a semester-long treatment of the same topics, see the instructor's YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSZp9QshJ8wwWjrsGDbguwcPLUwHWUxo0) for GR5058 at Columbia.

### Prerequisites

- A course on probability, such as GU4001, GR5203, or W5701 in Columbia's statistics department. If you have not taken such a course in person, you could work through the online [material](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) for Statistics 101 taught by Joe Blitzstein at Harvard. His textbook with Jessica Hwang is available online through [CLIO](http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?clio13062981) and there is a [cheatsheet](http://www.wzchen.com/s/probability_cheatsheet.pdf) compiled by some of the teaching assistants from that course.
- Familiarity with R for regression modeling using functions like lm(), glm(), etc.
	
- **Required reading**: [Chapter 1](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/rethinking/Statistical_Rethinking_sample.pdf) of _Statistical Rethinking_ by Richard McElreath, published by CRC Press in 2016.

### Getting started

#### Introductional Material

To get started here are some online resources for programming skills in R and for setting up the required R development environment.
